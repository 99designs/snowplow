# Hive analytics for SnowPlow

## Introduction

Hive is a very powerful tool for querying SnowPlow data.
A [cookbook of Hive recipes] [analyst-cookbook] is provided in the wiki: it provides a growing list of techniques and queries to use Hive to interrogate SnowPlow data.

### Example queries

Here are some example Hive queries which can be run on the SnowPlow data:

#### Count the number of unique visits in a day

	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `user_id`)
	FROM `snowplow_events_table`
	WHERE `dt`='2012-05-20'

#### Count the average number of pages-per-visit by day

	SELECT COUNT(`tm`)/COUNT(DISTINCT `visit_id`) /* Average pages per visit */
	FROM `snowplow_events_table`
	WHERE `event_action` IS NULL /* i.e. ignore any ajax events */ 
	GROUP BY `dt` /* group by date */
	
#### Look at the number of visitors brought to the site by referrer for 1st visits ONLY

	SELECT
		`mkt_source`,
		`mkt_medium`,
		`mkt_term`,
		`mkt_content`,
		`mkt_name`,
		COUNT(DISTINCT (user_id)),
	FROM
		`snowplow_events_table`
	WHERE
		`visit_id` = ` /* Only look at 1st visits for each user_id */
	GROUP BY `mkt_source`, `mkt_medium`, `mkt_term`, `mkt_content`, `mkt_name`

## Contents

The contents of this folder are as follows:

* In this folder is this README and Apache 2.0 License
* `snowplow-log-deserializers` is an SBT project containing the deserializers to import SnowPlow logs into [Apache Hive] [hive] ready for analysis
* `etl` contains the Ruby and Hive code to automate a nightly ETL (extract-transform-load) job to process the daily SnowPlow log files (_coming soon_)

## Documentation

Besides this README, we recommend reading:

* The [analyst cookbook] [analyst-cookbook], a growing list of techniques and queries for interrogating SnowPlow data using Hive
* The [README] [serdereadme] for the SnowPlow Log Deserializers repository
